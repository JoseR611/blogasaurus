        For my major, I want to study computer science.
        <br>
        When I was younger, I would have this computer that was incredibly slow.
        <br>
        However, while playing games on that ancient computer, I started to
        think about how everything worked. How did I earn points when I did something?
        How did the game know that I lost or I won?
        <br>
        This started an interest for me in computers and how they would work.
        <br>
        Now, I will go to Buffalo in order to learn more about them.
